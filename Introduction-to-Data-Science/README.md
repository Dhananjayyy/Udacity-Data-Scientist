**Introduction:**

In this project, I did the analysis for Stack Overflow Survey Data 2019. This is a survey data which I took from their website. This data contains nearly 90,000 responses from over 170 countries. I used jupyter notebook to do the analysis which you can find in the Data Science Blog Post.ipynb file.

For this analysis, I focused in answering these three questions:
1. Which country contributed the most to the survey?
2. Whatâ€™s the pay for developers in different countries like?
3. What is the framework of choice for developers?

-----

**Result Summary:**

After I did the analysis, these are the conclusion I found:
1. Developers from United States contributed most to the survey.
2. The United States, followed by United kingdom gives by far the highest of salaries of any nation.
3. Surprisingly, jQuery is the web framework of choice.
